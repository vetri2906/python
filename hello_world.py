print("hello world check")
print() # similar to \n
# if opened in single quotes - message inside should have double quotes
#nested single quotes or nested double quotes wont work
print('print("what to print")') 
print ('hello' + " " 'world')
#print() works in 3.x of python only and it is a function not a statement
#In earlier versions of python (python 2.x) print is a statement, like : print "hello world" this will throw error in python 3.x versions
